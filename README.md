# OWL Suits 2025
Rice University's software design solution for NASA Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students 2025. 
## Mission Concept & Tasks 
### Egress 
- demonstrate effective and efficient methods for completing the UIA (Umbilical Interface Assembly) procedures used to initiate an EVA (Extravehicular Activity) by preparing and checking the spacesuit’s portable life support systems
### EV Navigation
- implement a software system for tracking crew and scientific assets in the field, as well as aid crew members as they navigate the lunar surface
- include a system for detecting and navigating environmental hazards under lighting conditions like what you might experience at the lunar south pole
### Geological Sampling 
- demonstrate how your system can increase crewmember efficiency and reduce cognitive load
- interoperability would allow the PR (pressurized rover) to view data as it is collected
### Ingress 
- provide a “breadcrumbs” feature for retracing a path
- provide the shortest, safe path back to the airlock
