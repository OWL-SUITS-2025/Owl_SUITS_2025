# 🦉 Owl Suits 2025

**NASA SUITS Challenge – Rice University**

## 🚀 Overview

Owl Suits 2025 is Rice University’s submission to the **NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students) Challenge**.
Our project develops an **augmented reality (AR) interface** on the HoloLens 2 to support astronauts during **extravehicular activities (Ingress/Egress, Navigation, & Geological Sampling)**. The system enhances astronaut performance, safety, and efficiency through interactive visualizations, spatial navigation aids, and real-time data overlays.

## ✨ Features

* **AR EVA Interface** – Interactive step-by-step EVA guidance displayed directly in the astronaut’s view.
* **Real-Time Sensor Integration** – Telemetry and system data streamed to the interface for situational awareness.
* **Navigation & Mapping** – 2D visualization of lunar surface environments and wayfinding tools.
* **Procedural Checklists** – Hands-free task management and progress tracking.
* **Collaboration Tools** – Supports communication and data sharing with mission control.

## 🛰️ Mission Concept & Tasks  
### Geological Sampling  

* Inlcudes geological notebook integrated with XRF Spectrometer for elemental analysis. 
* Demonstrate how the AR system can increase crewmember efficiency and reduce cognitive load during sample collection.
* Ensure interoperability so that the PR (Pressurized Rover) can view data as it is collected.

### EV Navigation

* Implements a pin placing system to assist with navigation, avoid lunar hazards, and identify geological samples.
* Provide a “breadcrumbs” feature for retracing a path.

### Ingress / Egress

* Demonstrate effective and efficient methods for completing the UIA (Umbilical Interface Assembly) procedures used to initiate and complete an EVA by preparing and checking the spacesuit’s portable life support systems.  
* Utilizes just in time notifications and highlighted guides to assist with the process.
